# Welcome to the Ansible-Selfhosted Org.

This organization was created to centralize and organize a variety of Ansible collections aimed at the general self-hoster and homelabber. 

## Mission

Make the creation of a homelab a breeze to deploy and maintain while offering a great entry to ansible.

## Collections

The collections should follow these two simple rules: 

1. Create turnkey roles that either deploys various services or supplement those services.
2. Maintain a level of flexibility without being overwhelming.
